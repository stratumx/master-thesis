abstract = "The increasing integration of the Internet of Everything into the industrial value chain has built the foundation for the next industrial revolution called Industrie 4.0. Although Industrie 4.0 is currently a top priority for many companies, research centers, and universities, a generally accepted understanding of the term does not exist. As a result, discussing the topic on an academic level is difficult, and so is implementing Industrie 4.0 scenarios. Based on a quantitative text analysis and a qualitative literature review, the paper identifies design principles of Industrie 4.0. Taking into account these principles, academics may be enabled to further investigate on the topic, while practitioners may find assistance in identifying appropriate scenarios. A case study illustrates how the identified design principles support practitioners in identifying Industrie 4.0 scenarios."

In order to develop an open architecture software-CNC system on personal computer (PC) according to open modular architecture controllers (OMAC). First, the software and hardware platform is chosen and software realization methodology for the CNC system is determined. Second, static modeling methods of an open architecture controller inclusive of object-oriented (OO) programming technology, dynamic link library (DLL) technology and system modules partition are investigated. Third, the dynamical behavioral modeling and the data flow representation of open architecture controller are discussed, which are both described in hierarchy finite state machine (FSM) model. Fourth, a reusable software module model is established to develop software function module library. Finally, a 3-axis milling machine tool test-bed, named for HIT-CNC, is successfully designed by means of the constructed software function module library and the system configuring method. The experimental results show that, besides increasing the degree of reusability and openness, application of above-mentioned methodology leads to significant decrease of development time as well as maintenance cost."

However, with the development of numerical control technology existing CNC systems are limited with the interpreter lacking in expansibility, modularity and openness. In order to overcome these problems open architecture control was introduced. In this paper, a conceptual module of new software system is presented. The developed system is able to
interpret ISO 14649 and 6983 code and translate as per internal structure required by the CNC machine. It interprets position, feed rate, tool, spindle etc data and translates to CNC machine.

The hardware architecture is a multiprocessor distributed controller, with different levels of processing, and adaptable for different hardware specifications. A discussion of the basic control algorithms, with examples of implementation to the open source platform Arduino, is presented as part of the methodology. Other results in this paper include the preliminary test of the control to a two-axis CNC stage and a mathematical model of the control-loop in Simulink.

The introduction of open architecture philosophy propitiated the evolution of a new generation of numeric controllers. This brought the conventional CNC technology to the standard PC microcomputer. As a consequence, the characteristics of the CNC (positioning) and the micro computer (easy of programming, system configuration, network communication etc) are combined. There are also a number of commercially available OAC (Open Architecture controllers) (e.g. MDSI, Fanuc, Okuma, Siemens). There are also a number of efforts at developing OAC standards [1- 4]. This paper uses Siemens [5] OAC to build the unique BlackBox for machine tool industry. This new technology in machine tool industry helps us in understanding the cause of crash or malfunctioning of machine or machine health by means of debugging the critical machine data such as Spindle Speed, Axis positions, Feed rates, Type of Tool used etc which are facilitated by this application just before the crash and same can be accessed remotely via Internet/Ethernet.

The formal specification assumes a critical role in order to understand and synthesise those complex systems. The Petri nets formalism is adequate to model and validate the dynamic behaviour, but present weak points when the system contains many instances of the same component, since the model grows (structure and components) in a non-controllable manner. The use of high-level Petri nets, allows to reduce this complexity, by compressing the representation of states, actions and events, to overcome the identified limitations and to support more complex and bigger coordination scenarios. We present a formal specification of the ADACOR product holons using high-level Petri nets and the associated formal validation of the model."

The design of intelligent drives for this system follows a hardware–software co-design approach using a simple and intuitive structure. The hardware units of the proposed system integrate control and monitoring functions providing an FPGA-based open architecture for reconfigurable applications. On the other hand, software components were developed utilizing the XML structure for system description files, gathering features like a flowchart descriptive language and a graphic user-interface. MADCON was applied to a retrofitted to CNC lathe for control and monitoring in order to validate the proposed architecture towards the development of new generation intelligent manufacturing systems."

In this scenario, spectral methods are extremely promising as they provide a natural library of tools for shape analysis, intrinsically defined by the shape itself. In particular, the eigenfunctions of the Laplace–Beltrami operator yield a set of real-valued functions that provide interesting insights in the structure and morphology of the shape. In this paper, we first analyze different discretizations of the Laplace–Beltrami operator (geometric Laplacians, linear and cubic FEM operators) in terms of the correctness of their eigenfunctions with respect to the continuous case. We then present the family of segmentations induced by the nodal sets of the eigenfunctions, discussing its meaningfulness for shape understanding."

SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF's application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF's usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision."

This may involve producing a plurality of difference images by blurring an initial image to produce a blurred image and by subtracting the blurred image from the initial image to produce the difference image. For each difference image, pixel amplitude extrema are located and a corresponding pixel region is defined about each pixel amplitude extremum. Each pixel region is divided into subregions and a plurality of component subregion descriptors are produced for each subregion. These component subregion descriptors are correlated with component subregion descriptors of an image under consideration and an object is indicated as being detected when a sufficient number of component subregion descriptors (scale invariant features) define an aggregate correlation exceeding a threshold correlation with component subregion descriptors (scale invariant features) associated with the object.}

The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data. High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition."
